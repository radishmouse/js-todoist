* My Todoist Inbox is huge.

I keep adding to it from my Android's Share menu. And then it becomes a black hole of sadness, where all my hopes and dreams go to die.

So, my goal with this is to create an app that can grab those todos and put them into a local database, possibly with a more keyboard-friendly (possibly CLI) front-end.

** Example Task JSON

#+BEGIN_SRC js

  { id: 89358380,
    project_id: 2151379050,
    content:
     'The Basics of Package.json in Node.js and Npm The Basics of Package.json in Node.js and Npm http://hn.premii.com/#/article/13832025 (Hacker News)',
    completed: false,
    label_ids: [],
    order: 6,
    indent: 1,
    priority: 1,
    comment_count: 0,
    url: 'https://todoist.com/showTask?id=89358380' },

#+END_SRC
** Modeling the TODOs in SQL

This is pretty straight-forward. Unless we want to mimic the users and projects on Todoist, we will simply keep track of completion.

We might want to track the =completed_on=, (maybe) the =created_on=, and the =remote_id=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql

create table todos (
  id serial primary key,
  title varchar(255) not null,
  url varchar(255) not null,
  completed_on timestamp,
  remote_id bigint
);

#+END_SRC


** Building a front-end

For this, I'll be using Express, and just returning ES6 template strings.
